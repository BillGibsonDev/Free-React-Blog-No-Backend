## Free React Blog with NO BACKEND

Demo: https://gleaming-taffy-8ae1fb.netlify.app/

This is a simple blog that does not use a database or server.

No need to worry about slow heroku or render servers load time.

Instead we created a JavaScript File that will contain the blog posts.

We are able to dynamically create posts with the help of <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#emphasis" target="_blank">marked</a>. Which is a package used for creating markdown.
